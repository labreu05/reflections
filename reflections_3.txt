When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
      -when i want to send my data to the common. or when i need content new from the commits that other users have made.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
      - Because i need to know if really i want to have any change to my local, if its automatically may cause many errors on my local branch.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-Forks: Kind of clone in github.
	-Clones: Clone a repository from the web or locally.
	-Branches: Son ramas de un proyecto que permiten modificar indirectamente el master.
