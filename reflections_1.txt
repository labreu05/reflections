How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    - yes, because you can easily find where the bug is, so you can roll back and fix it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    - That helps because the programmer can find things that where did in the past by him or someone else 
	use that to improve some work, and things like that.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    - the pros are: you can save the files whenever you get a significant part of the work done.
    - the cons: you may forget to save something important.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    - because when you are working with a project, sometimes you generate more than 1 file, and every file thats is linked 
	to the project is important to the program.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    - To easy find a bug or get back to something we did previously.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    - because you can work more freely, and if you brake something you can get back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    - for work on a project from the webdevelopment coursee of udacity.
